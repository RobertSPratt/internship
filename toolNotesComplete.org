#+TITLE: Tool Notes Complete

* Communication tools
** Slack
- Can join with Tri-C account
  + three workspaces are available for Tri-C accounts to join
  + has the ability to create a new workspace
*** What is this tool?
- Slack is a communication tool that allows for text, audio, and video communication.
*** Why would you want to use it?
- Within a workspace, replies can be made in threads to avoid cluttering the main conversation
- Cross-platform support, including Android and iOS apps
  + these apps update simultaneously with the web implementation
  + desktop notifications are possible
*** How does it work?
- An instructor or group leader would make a workspace and invite everyone they would like to participate with either an e-mail invite or a link to the workspace. Organization e-mails can also have workspaces that are available by default. Once in a workspace, communication can happen on the main channel just as in any other chat software, including private messages and group chats. Voice/video chats can be started by clicking on the the phone icon near the person's name (either in the direct message or on their profile), but only up to 15 people can be on a call.
*** What disciplines would it work best for?
- Special topics courses
- Courses that focus a lot on group work
- Philosophy
- Lab courses
*** Any other useful tidbits?
- Works on across all browsers (and operating systems) I've tested
  + Chromium-based, Firefox, mobile browsers, Android and iOS apps
- The 15-person limit on calls makes it difficult to use for lecturs and most courses
- Allows reactions as both replies and to replies
- Pricing depends on organization size, but those sizes aren't listed
  + Medium to Large organizations are $12.95/month, but Large organizations require custom quotes

** Teach, Learn, Lead
*** What is this tool?
- This appears to be a social media tool for teachers to communicate with other teachers to gain advice, ideas, and support at the start of their careers.
*** Why would you want to use it?
- Teachers have the ability to reac out to other teachers for new ideas to improve their lectures or find a way to teach a subject or work with a student.
*** How does it work?
- A teacher signs up using their e-mail, Facebook, or LinkedIn account, and then sees a wall of recent activity similar to most other social media platforms. The teacher can then read recent activity; post their own questions or thoughts; or navigate around different topics and search the platform for anything that might interest them.
*** What disciplines would it work best for?
- Teachers of any discipline, but isn't directly useable in a lecture/lab.
*** Any other useful tidbits?
- After signing up, my feed had a spam post from a week ago and then nothing else newer than a month old, even if selected to show all activity.
  + This makes me wonder about how active the user base is
- Appears to be free, but doesn't appear to provide anything that isn't already offered through Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., especially since this is a personal resource and doesn't seem to have any enterprise benefits.
- Does not have an app, but mobile website functions fine.
  + The mobile sites has links to download an app that can work with their site

* Note-taking/documentation tools
** Evernote
- Works with Tri-C account.
*** What is this tool?
- A tool for taking notes, anotating PDFs, and collaborating with others on the notebook (essentially a folder holding all of the notes and pdfs). Folders can also include pictures from the device, or take them with the camera, or record audio files for the notebook, as well. Web clipper allows for copying of a webpage directly into a notebook (text comes in as text and images as images).
*** How does it work?
- Instructor downloads the app, either a mobile app or desktop app, or signs in on the web-browser. There features availble to the user varies depending on the implementation used:
**** Browser
- Can insert photos, tables, checkboxes, and code snippets and attach documents. Text editor allows for superscript and subscript, hyperlinks, ordered and unordered lists, checklists, and the usual text editor tools.
- Notebooks can quickly be given tags and shared with others.
***** Web Clipper Addon
- Available on Firefox and Chromium-base Browsers (including Edge)
**** Desktop App (Windows)
- Editor is similar to a text editor (Google Docs, MS Word, LibreOffice, etc.)
- Can record audio, attach documents, take and add photos, attach file from Google Drive, insert a table, and insert a code block.
- Can play audio recordings in the app.
**** Desktop App (Mac) #TODO: Test the Mac App when Macbook arrives.
**** Tusk Desktop App (Unofficial Linux App)
- This is the browser implementation in a desktop app.
  + Has all of the functionality of the browser version with the addition of a system tray icon for quick launching.
**** NixNote2 Desktop App (Unofficial Linux App)
- Can add text notes, tags, source urls, set the author of a note, insert tables, and mark as done.
- Very limited in terms of functionality and not the most intuitive to set up.
**** Mobile App (Android & iOS)
- Editor is redesigned for mobile, so there isn't much of a task bar/menu.
  + Four icons exist at the bottom:
    1. take/attach photo from device,
    2. record and attach audio,
    3. sketch/handwriting,
    and
    4. attach file.
  + Tapping at the bottom of a notebook will allow for new notes to be typed in (and any of the above options can be added into the note).
- Web clipper to import websites into the notebook, with text importing as text and images as images.
*** What disciplines wouldit work best for?
- IT/Programming
- Mathematics
- Science (Physics & Chemistry)
- Art
- English
- Foreign languages/ESL
*** Any other useful tidbits?
- Evernote Business is listed at $14.99/user/month, but there is not education option listed.
  + Student discount gives 50% off the first year.
- Notebooks can be shared with those without an account, but they can only view it.
  + Those with an account can collaborate within a notebook, set reminders, and add tags.
- PDF annotation has preset shapes (such as arrows) to use to draw attention to content.

* Anotation tools

* Screen recording/video lecture tools
** Doceri
** Educreations
-

* Instruction/lesson tools (non-video)
** Expeditions
- Requires a Google account
  + Would have to set Tri-C account up as a Google one, so I instead used my personal account.
*** What is this tool?
- Expeditions is a virtual field trip/presentation tool. It can be used to discuss locations and items/models without having to be there or with them in person.
*** Why would you want to use it?
- Instead of using low-quality slide copies in a lecture, or trying to project a physical model to a smartboard, these 3D models can be displayed and discussed, instead. This also holds true when discussing locations that are unreasable to travel to for a lecture.
*** How does it work?
- The app can be used in two ways:
  1. The official way is to download the app to the instructor's phone or tablet and either:
     a. going around the class room showing the students the model
     or
     b. providing the students with devices with the app installed (or having them download it onto their own) and a VR viewer (or cardboard holder) and taking them on a virtual tour of the model/site.
  2. This should also work with a screencast to display what is on the app on a tablet to a computer/smartboard (or even a virtual lecture).
*** What disciplines would it work best for?
- History
- Sciences
- Art
- IT
- English Literature
- Sociology
- Cultural Anthropology
*** Any other useful tidbits?
- It appears to be free to use, including all of the tours I took.
- Works well on both Android and iOS.
- It seems as though most tours can be done as AR or VR, but VR might be required for some.
** Google Tour Creator
- Requires a Google account
  + Would have to set Tri-C account up as a Google one, so I used my personal account instead.
*** What is this tool?
- Tour Creator allows for the creation of 3D virtual tours using Google Street View and Google's library of images inside locations.
*** How does it work?
- The instructor signs up to use the Tour Creator and selects to create a tour, assigning the tour a cover photo, title, description, and catagory. Then, they search for a place and can drop the street view character (golden person above the zoom controls on the map) on a place to look around; valid locations will be outlined and the streetview will snap to the closest valid point, if dropped on an invalid one. Next, they click "add scene" to set a "starting view" and can then assign the scene details such as title, place, description, credits, ambient sounds, narration, and points of interest. Once all of the scenes are added, the instructor clicks the "Publish" button on the top of the screen.
*** What disciplines would it work best for?
- Art
- Cultural anthroplogy
- Sociology
- English literature
- History
- Foreign languages/ESL
- Engineering/Urban development
*** Any other useful tidbits?
- It appears to be free to use, including synching it up with Google Expiditions
- If tours are created with the same Google account as is used with Expeditions, then the tours can easily used through that tool.
- Some places, such as the Muzeul de Arta in Constanta, Romania allows for tours to be taken inside of their facility, including views close to the art exhibits (as shown in my example).

** Webjets
- Works just fine with Tri-C account, but the e-mails from it were flagged as spam.
*** What is this tool?
- Webjets is a artboard-style tool that allows for ideas, links, and documents to be grouped and organized in a logical manner.
*** How does it work?
- The instructor can create an artboard for a specific class, lecture, or project/assignment. Once created, they can place cards, mindmaps, folders, lists, links, documents, etc. onto the artboard and organize them on the board as would best fit the item or instructor's purpose. Webjets has a button to easily import both Wikipedia articles and Youtube videos. Folders can contain other folders, cards, lists, links, and everything else to keep those items organized (the same is true for every other type of object, as well). Those items can also be given additional views that give them there own space on the artboard for better viewing. The artboard can be shared with specific people, giving them editing or view permissions, or it can be published and distributed with a link.
*** What disciplines would it work best for?
- English Literature
- Foreign Languages/ESL
- History
- IT Programming and Networking
- Courses that focus around large projects
*** Any other useful tidbits?
- Webjets is free to sign up, but with limited storage space and number of boards.
  + Educational plans are listed as free, but I do not know if there is a limitation to this account.
    - There is also no mention of how often reverification might need to happen.
- Pretty intuitive to use in terms of creation, but might not be so for a student viewing a lesson.
